## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is a revolutionary approach to software development introduced by computer scientist Andrej Karpathy in February 2025. It represents a paradigm shift in how we think about and create software:

- **Natural Language First**: Instead of writing code manually, developers describe their intentions in plain language
- **AI-Powered Development**: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate the corresponding code based on these descriptions
- **Developer as Guide**: The role shifts from manual coding to guiding, testing, and refining AI-generated code
- **Accessibility**: Makes software development more approachable for those without extensive programming backgrounds
